## Purpose
NoSQL databases like MongoDB are popular options for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This app is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thouhgts,react to freinds' thoughts, and create a friends list. The app uses Expres.js, a MongoDB databse, and Mongoose. The application has no front-end functionality so it must be ran through the command line and tested in an API design platform like Insomnia. Simply clone the code, install required packages, and run `node server.js` on your terminal to launch the application.

## Tech-Used
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express.js
- Node.js

## Installation
