## Purpose
NoSQL databses like MongoDB are popular options for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This app is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thouhgts,react to freinds' thoughts, and create a friend list. The app uses Expres.js for routing, a MongoDB databse, and the Mongoose ODM. The application has no front-end functionality so it must be ran through the command line and test in an API design platform. Simply clone the code, install required packages, and run npm on your terminal.

## Installation
To run the app you must have Node.js installed. Clone the repo and run `npm i` to install node dependencies. To start the application run `npm start` and test the API routes with any API design platform.
